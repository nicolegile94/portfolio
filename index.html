                <P>... and I'm a professional software tester. Starting college I was positive I was going to graduate, go on to grad school, and become an Audiologist. Turns out that I didn't like audiology all that much, so halfway through my junior year I switched majors with no plan for the future. Majoring in History and Psychology gave me many great skills, but no specific direction for a career. My best friend was a software developer, and he suggested I apply for some QA positions. Well, the rest is history. I fell in love with testing. It was the perfect mix of logic, critical thinking, and in a faced pace environment. </p>
                <p>My first year and a half as a tester I worked for Epic Systems Corportation, where I focused on testing the Medical Administration Record for Inpatients in hospitals. While at Epic I was also introduced to the concept of usabiltiy, and took several graduate level UXD courses. Seeking a different atmosphere I switched companies to Johnson Health Tech. For the first two years of my employment I tested the Android based fitness consoles (think like the consoles on treadmills and bikes). After two years I switched teams internally, and moved to the web team. Now I am the sole tester on a web based interactive bike project. Working so closely with the developers peaked my interest in coding. Taking the UW Web Dev bootcamp has been eye opening. I adore coding, and although my heart still lies with QA, I now have such a deeper understanding of what I'm working on. </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I am a busy bee. I am obsessed with basically anything related to theater (singing, dancing, acting, etc.), but my passion is improvisation. When not on stage, I am probably hiking, reading, or baking. My husband and I plan on hiking the Ice Age Trail over the next few years, and try to get to at least one segment a week. Reading has always been a great joy of mine, and although I'll read just about any book mysteries and thrillers are my favorite. Baking has become a quarintine activity that I picked up, and it looks like it's going to be a hobby that sticks. </p>
                 <p>My friends describe me as silly, kind, and a huge dork. I love being around people, and nothing makes me happier than making people laugh.</P>
